# comrade-clean
comrade-clean is a simple program written in C that serves no other purpose than to have a laugh. I got the inspiration from reddit user Gambatte over at the TalesFromTechSupport subreddit.

The [normal output of the program](http://i.imgur.com/0s8wWES.png) is in Russian, because I felt like it should be, and makes perfect sense like that (my Russian is not perfect though, if anyone spots some errors, please do let me know).  
The [output of the program in English](http://i.imgur.com/xFCfbla.png) is an almost exact copy of Gambatte's post.  
Another little 'project' was the [phonetic output of the program](http://i.imgur.com/EEnXcrz.png). Since I'm natively Dutch, I had to try to think of the English phonetic pronouncuation.  
And the [credits](http://i.imgur.com/7O0C4UI.png). I just had to put that in.  
I also created another [alias](http://i.imgur.com/jzYGq1u.png) for it, just because `clean` is not a package on my system.
